# Site

This is still a work in progress. I do not know if I plan on transferring the original site over to GitHub's servers yet.
I'm considering about using this as a backup website and to save certain files. Who knows, this can be used as a small server
if it is not abused and detected by GitHub. Actually, this wouldn't be too bad for file storage.
